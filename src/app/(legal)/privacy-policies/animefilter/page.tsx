        <PolicySection title="6. Use of AIProxy and GeminiAPI Services">
          <PolicyParagraph>
            The Application allows users to transform their photos using AI-powered cartoon filters. When a user selects an image to transform, the following process occurs:
          </PolicyParagraph>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gruvbox-fg/80 space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li>The selected image is first transmitted to AIProxy, a service that acts as an intermediary between the Application and GeminiAPI. AIProxy masks the API key to protect it during the communication process.</li>
            <li>The image along with style information is then forwarded to GeminiAPI, where using AI models the image is transformed into the selected cartoon style.</li>
            <li>The transformed image is sent back to AIProxy, which in turn relays the results to the user within the Application.</li>
          </ul>
          <PolicyParagraph>
            It is important to note that while the image is processed by GeminiAPI, the Operator does not have direct access to the user images or transformed results. The image processing is conducted solely for the purpose of providing the user with the requested service, and any data transmitted is handled according to GeminiAPI&apos;s and AIProxy&apos;s privacy policies. Users are encouraged to review the{' '}
